# Tidepool Developer Portal

This is Tidepool's developer microsite. If you are looking for our company web site, please visit [tidepool.org](https://tidepool.org).

We are building an internet application platform and series of applications to help reduce the burden of managing Type 1 Diabetes. We're a nonprofit organization doing everything in the open. Open source, open business, and we need lots of help.

This is a microsite for helping to guide and manage the open source nature of our work. Its intended audience is software developers who are interested in helping us continuously improve the way we serve the Type 1 Diabetes community.

This is a work in progress. If you find something particularly confusing, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tidepool-org.github.io/issues) with suggestions on how it could be clearer. (Note: we *don't* use GitHub Issues to track issues on our platform and application repositories. Open source contributors are welcome to file issues on GitHub, but our process will be to ingest them into our project management process (currently mainly on Trello) and close them.)

## Getting started

1. Read about getting the stack running on your own machine with [starting services](starting-up-services).
1. Read our [data model](data-model-v1/v1) documentation to understand what medical data we ingest and how it's organized.
1. Visit [Tidepool on GitHub](https://github.com/tidepool-org) to see our active repositories and how they fit together.
1. If you're looking for more reference details, check out [our references page](references).
