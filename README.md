# Tidepool Developer Portal

This is a Tidepool microsite for helping to guide and manage the open source nature of our work.

This is a GitHub Pages site, and the deployed site can be found [here](http://developer.tidepool.org/).

If you want to run it locally, you should have a Ruby installation working and follow [GitHub's instructions for installing Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#installing-jekyll).

To render the site, do `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`, then visit http://localhost:4000 in your browser. 

While that's running, you can then edit the site, save the result, and reload the web page to see it on your local site.
