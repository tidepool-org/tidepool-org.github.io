#### 3.2 WHAT INFORMATION DOES TIDEPOOL COLLECT AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES?
**Registration and Contact Information**

To register as a User, you must provide your email address and create a password. You use your email address and password to log in. We may also collect contact information, such as your name, address, phone number, and certain non-personal information that does not itself identify you, such as your IP address.  

We may use this information to: deliver, administer and improve the Tidepool Apps; provide customer service; improve and personalize your experience; better understand your needs; fulfill requests you make; deliver special announcements and updates about the Tidepool Apps; and contact you about any of the above as well as any changes to or notifications regarding your Account. 

**Other Information You Provide to Us**

We also collect other information you provide to us through the Tidepool Apps. This includes your gender, age and birth date, weight, height, treatment and diagnosis information, health and well-being related information (including diet and activity information), information identifying the diabetes monitoring and treatment devices you use, and data you upload from your diabetes monitoring and treatment devices using Tidepool Uploader. If you choose to, you can upload a photo of yourself to be used as your profile photo.  

We use this information to provide the visualization, data analysis, and other features available through the Tidepool Apps, which are also available to any Care Team Members you choose. When you seek support from us, the individual(s) providing you with support may need to access your information in order to identify the problem you are seeking support for, though the use of your information will only be used to help provide you with support. 

With your permission, we may also provide internal, diagnostic data from your diabetes device to the maker of that device, include your anonymized data in the Tidepool Anonymized Diabetes Database, or share your information with third-party applications that you choose to connect with. 

**Data Access for Device Makers**

You have the option of granting the maker of your diabetes monitoring or treatment device with access to the information you upload from the device via the Tidepool Uploader. Providing your device maker with access to this data may assist the device maker in provide customer support or diagnose and address issues with the device. Providing data access to the device maker also helps them understand how their devices are being used, which helps them make better devices in the future. We may charge device makers a monthly fee for access to this data. 

You may choose to provide the makers certain device makers, including but not limited to the following, with information collected from your device via the Tidepool Uploader:
* Asante Snap 
* Dexcom G4 
* Insulet OmniPod 
* Tandem t:slim

Your device manufacturer may be able to identify you based on the serial number associated with the device and other information about you in its possession. 

**Tidepool Anonymized Diabetes Database**

You have the option to donate your anonymized data to the Tidepool Anonymized Diabetes Database, a database made available for diabetes research. Diabetes researchers have a very hard time getting access to quality data from diabetes devices. We are making the Tidepool Anonymized Diabetes Database available for free to anyone agreeing to the applicable terms of use. By doing this we hope to contribute to a dramatic acceleration in the rate of innovation in diabetes care.

You will not be identifiable based on the information you donate to the Tidepool Anonymized Diabetes Database. We take care to store identifying information (like your name, address, or birthday) separately from the donated data. If you agree to donate your information, here is the information you will be donating (if provided):

For each User:
* Included: birth month and year, month and year of date of diagnosis, gender, and weight. 
* Not included: name, address, email address, birthdate, or other personal identifying information  

For all diabetes devices:
* Included: data from the device correlated over time, brand and model of the device (if also permitted by the device maker). 
* Not included: device serial number

For blood glucose meters:
* Included: blood glucose readings and time stamps
* 
For continuous glucose meters (“CGM”):
* Included: estimated glucose values and time stamps, events tracked by the CGM, including meals, insulin, calibration, exercise, health 

For insulin pumps:
* Included: all pump settings, including bolus wizard parameters, basal rates, basal rate profiles, insulin to carb ratios, and insulin sensitivity factor

For exercise monitors:
* Included: Exercise and activity data imported from devices or software, such as FitBit, FuelBand, Strava, and RunKeeper (not including GPS data or personally identifying information). 

We will not include in the anonymized diabetes database (1) freeform text and notes entered by you or anyone you’ve provided access to or (2) any other data that could identify a specific individual. 

The data from your device will be correlated across time and with the donated User information using a random, cryptographically secure user key (a “one-way hash”). This identifier is “one-way,” which means that not even we can figure out who it refers to. However, having this key allows researchers to correlate multiple data points over time from a single person.

**Third-Party Applications**

You may have the option to link or connect Tidepool Apps and the information collected with Tidepool Apps with certain third-party applications.  We will always ask your permission before sharing your information with any third-party application.
