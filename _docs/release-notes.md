# Tidepool Release Notes  

We love GitHub, but it can be an intimidating place for newcomers if you don't know where to look, or what you're looking for. To help with that, these release notes will make updates to Tidepool for Web, the Tidepool Uploader, and Tidepool Mobile a bit more readable.  

Because we love transparency, along with a description of what's new, each update includes a link out to the specific GitHub repository release (**Code Update**) and relevant public Trello cards (**Feature Requirements**) so you can get a better sense of who, what, when, where, and why.

### 1.23.0 (Released 2019-07-05)
We're starting off July with a bugfix bonanza. First, we cleaned up some spacing and formatting when you edit your profile.  
[Feature Requirements](https://tidepool.atlassian.net/browse/WEB-35)

And if you enter text without spaces in your profile, we fixed a bug that caused spacing to expand beyond the page width.  
[Feature Requirements](https://tidepool.atlassian.net/browse/WEB-36)

Last, we resolved a bug that caused high CPU usage, even when there's no data in the account.  
[Feature Requirements](https://tidepool.atlassian.net/browse/WEB-37)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.23.0)

### 1.22.1 (Released 2019-06-24)
Another casualty of the update from "Weekly" to "BG Log", the average BG statistic in our print view stopped showing up. But it's back now. Sorry about that.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/i2k5qiZX/32-avg-bg-value-missing-from-print-view-pdf)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.22.1)

### 1.22.0 (Released 2019-06-18)
Now that our summer interns are up and running, we can address a bunch of bugs and smaller updates. Here's a fresh batch.  

Spacing of text in user profiles appears off when they try to edit their information. This bug has been squashed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/T8eld2pY/22-spacing-of-text-in-user-profile-when-trying-to-edit-information-is-off)

Accounts with over 53 characters in their name were causing our print view to break. Yes, that's a highly specific number, but we've resolved this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/vkFPC0yL/23-inability-to-render-print-view-for-account-names-over-certain-character-count)

If there's no blood glucose meter data in an account, users would see an error when switching from the Basics to BG Log view. This bug has been resolved.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/bsnBhR7g/24-page-reload-when-switching-to-basics-from-empty-bg-log-view)

If a user's first site change or cannula prime was outside the reporting window for the Basics view, the time stamp on that event would display as "NaN". We've fixed this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/8y1XNWwZ/25-nan-on-cannula-prime-or-site-changes)

We got a bug report from a few users who were using an app on their iPhone that was writing blood glucose values of "0" to Apple Health, which in turn caused problems with Tidepool Web. This has been addressed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/3u361BoE/26-web-fails-to-load-data-views-due-to-nonpositive-integer)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.22.0)

### 1.21.0 (Released 2019-06-06)
Previously, if you wanted to share your Tidepool account with someone and accidentally added an extra space to the end of the email address, Tidepool Web would get upset. We've resolved this bug and extra spaces should no longer be an issue.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/r3GiIwuA/5-strip-out-extra-spaces-in-share-email-fields)

A user uploading 670G data notified us that their Time in Auto Mode data was not displaying in the Basics and Daily views. Turns out they had a different device model than our code was expecting, so we've updated some things to get that Auto Mode data showing again.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/KDHf69KK/6-time-in-auto-stat-not-showing-for-medtronic-670g-devices-with-devicemodel-1782)

For users creating accounts on their phone, the completed signup page now includes links to Tidepool Mobile to remind you that Tidepool Mobile is a thing.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/hZi8zF50/7-add-links-to-tidepool-mobile-apps-on-browser-recommendation-page)

As we continue to work on improvements on things behind the scenes, we have to ensure our old code and platform continue to work as they currently do if anything in development goes wrong.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/2JUwzDOg/29-fall-back-to-host-path-for-api-requests-when-apihost-variable-not-provided)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.21.0)

### 1.20.2 (Released 2019-05-13)
Remember when we changed the "Weekly" view to "BG Log"? Turns out we reintroduced a bug that caused the Trends view to get upset. We've fixed that bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/35ylrPLC/14-2-week-filter-on-trends-view-throws-js-error)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.20.1)

### 1.20.1 (Released 2019-05-08)
Tidepool Web used to get mad when a clinician logged in and had a patient with a blank name. Thankfully, this bug is now resolved.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/B9XpWkdc/5-clinician-account-not-loading-no-clear-cause)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.20.1)

### 1.20.0 (Released 2019-04-24)
Giving some love to our Print View, we've updated the printed widgets to reflect our new aggregated statistics.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/zCsP7dCr/45-use-new-agg-stats-calculations-in-tidepool-webs-print-views)

And we now print carbs that are not associated with a bolus wizard event.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/doJpZONa/47-print-carbs-on-platform-that-are-not-associated-with-bolus-wizard-events)

Finally, we've renamed the "Weekly" view to "BG Log", which seems much more appropriate considering the intended use.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/ju5mApHk/46-rename-weekly-to-bg-log)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.20.0)

### 1.19.0 (Released 2019-04-15)
Some users wearing Medtronic 530G were not seeing their device settings. That's our bad. This has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/xNVdNQ1W/23-medtronic-pumps-not-showing-device-settings-530g)

A few users experienced a crash when trying to access their profile page. Turns out this was a result of people attempting to support a nonprofit organization that was removed from the Big Data Donation Project list. Shoutout to fans of the Diabetes Hands Foundation. This bug has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1JmHhwKi/22-profile-page-crashing-post-removal-of-bdd-target)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.19.0)

### 1.18.0 (Released 2019-03-28)
Accounts with extremely wide variability made our standard deviation widget unhappy, causing Tidepool Web to crash. We've crunched the numbers and resolved this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/YcHZj4dI/27-tidepool-web-crashes-when-rendering-sd-stat-widget-when-sd-mean)

For accounts with default blood glucose targets, we noticed the 70 and 54 on the y-axis in the Trends view were displayed on top of each other. This only happened in certain scenarios, but it's still not a good look so we fixed this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/EnbpV4VY/28-on-int-prod-with-default-target-bg-range-the-trends-y-axis-displays-70-and-54-on-top-of-one-another-for-t-slim-animas-omnipod-an)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.18.0)

### 1.17.0 (Released 2019-03-05)
There was a data paging bug that was triggered in instances where a large gap of time without data is followed by a data point that is diabetes-specific (like a data point) rather than device-related (like an insulin pump event). In such cases, data that occurs before the gap would not be segmented and loaded (we call this paging), but instead would be fetched and processed all at once. Depending on how much data exists before the gap, the browser will either slow or crash. Which is a bummer, so we fixed that.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/6tfqWKVM/6-v1170-some-user-accounts-processing-all-fetched-data-at-once)

Carb events uploaded from Apple Health or coming in from the Dexcom API that are not associated with a bolus are now displayed in Tidepool Web. We'll get to independent carb events from Tidepool Uploader soon.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/0WUNaQS6/5-v1170-display-carbs-from-platform-which-are-not-associated-with-bolus-calculator-ie-wizard-event-in-tidepool-web)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.17.0)

### 1.16.1 (Released 2019-03-01)
Coming in hot! We noticed this after releasing v1.16.0: when logged in as a clinician, the scrollbar in the patient list disappeared. I'm told by our engineers this was a 2-line fix. Sounds simple enough.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/EMApNn9D/2-regression-scrollbar-missing-from-vca-patients-list)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.16.1)

### 1.16.0 (Released 2019-02-28)
This is a big one, folks. Tidepool Web now shows a bunch of new aggregated statistics including more detailed time-in-range calculations, basal/bolus breakdowns, sensor usage, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and a Glucose Management Indicator (GMI). It's quite lovely, and a hefty design and engineering effort. Here's what went down.  

Here's the bulk of the work, adding standardized aggregated statistics to each view in Tidepool Web.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/suWzyusJ/31-v1160-standardize-aggregated-agg-stats-widgets-data-viz-general)

During testing, we noticed a bunch of bugs that got resolved along the way including...this one that showed 7 days of data across 8 calendar days. Math is hard.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/eChXb9fM/30-v1160-trends-view-is-showing-7-days-of-data-across-8-calendar-days)

And Daylight Saving Time anomalies were detected and resolved, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/ys6jgrZG/29-v1160-dst-anomalies-on-trends-view)

Tooltips in the Trends view were not behaving as intended, but we got them back in line.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/odgzZl39/28-v1160-trends-tooltips-display-behind-the-new-agg-stats)

Initial data loading in the Trends view didn't always include all the appropriate CGM data. That got fixed, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/ok6BjAPE/27-v1160-immediately-after-initial-load-cgm-data-not-accessible-in-trends-view)

While we were in the code, we fixed some of the abbreviations for unit measurements.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LobK0FUb/32-v1160-units-abbreviations-should-be-capitalized-on-daily-view-chart-headers)

We noticed user-entered data was not being included in the Average Daily Insulin widget, but we caught that before everything was published.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/8w4zfRPq/34-v1160-regression-user-entered-data-for-the-new-avg-daily-insulin-widget-does-not-persist)

And, Tidepool Web has a new font, just like our marketing site. The coordination is clutch.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/nCSk7Bn6/33-v1160-swap-font-families-in-apptidepool-from-open-sans-to-basis)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.16.0)

### 1.15.0 (Released 2019-02-11)
We've added the Weekly View to our Print View option. Now you'll get 30 days of blood glucose data in addition to the Basics, Daily, and Device Settings included in the PDF printout. Enjoy!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1H0rCVys/8-1150-print-view-weekly)

Automated suspend events (see, Basal-IQ) with no duration information caused Tidepool Web to display an error on the Daily View. That's been fixed now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/5arkE8Ra/7-1150web-suspend-without-duration-errors-on-tidepool-web)

For accounts with very little data, Tidepool Web would throw an error message and stop rendering data. Sorry about that, folks. This has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pEdbpu6t/9-1150-data-indexing-array-error-on-web-on-accounts-w-very-little-data)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.15.0)

### 1.14.1 (Released 2019-01-31)
Coming in hot! Our handy Beacon helper was blocking important elements - like the "Sign up" button - on smaller phones, so we decided to hide it from the mobile experience.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/8LDAJNLx/30-beacon-help-icon-overlaps-key-ui-components-for-mobile-signup-workflow)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.14.1)

### 1.14.0 (Released 2019-01-09)
If you upload insulin data via Tidepool Mobile and happen to have previously uploaded Medtronic 523 or 723 pump data, we'll automatically hide your Medtronic pump data from any direct Tidepool Uploader uploads during or after September 2017 (when Apple Health was first introduced). You're data is still there, but we figure it's best to avoid duplicate data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/M7DAflId/5-blip-when-insulin-healthkit-uploads-begin-hide-medtronic-direct-uploads-after-insulin-healthkit-introduction-began-september-201)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.14.0)

### 1.13.0 (Released 2018-12-19)
Adding support for Basal-IQ data brought to light the fact that we do not differentiate between basal rates that are manually and automatically suspended. We added a friendly indicator to denote the times basal rates were automatically suspended.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/wZk0cMNU/35-distinguish-between-auto-and-manual-suspend-for-plgs-like-basal-iq)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.13.0)

### 1.12.6 (Released 2018-11-13)
We added a handy plugin called Beacon to Tidepool Web to provide faster access to our support articles, guides, and walkthroughs. With Beacon, you can also send an email to our support team or even chat live with us if you have questions without leaving the page. Our goal is to get you answers to your questions faster so you can get back to exploring your data. Enjoy!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/GILzFQMb/6-add-helpscout-beacon-to-apptidepoolorg)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.12.6)

### 1.12.5 (Released 2018-10-25)
Blood glucose values imported from Apple Health that were shown as HIGH BG or LOW BG in Tidepool Web generated a message that "Tidepool is stuck and isn't doing what you want it to do". With this fix, we unstuck Tidepool and it should do what you want it to do now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pQv4sTKV/22-uncaught-typeerror-on-high-bg-annotations-in-data-imported-through-tidepool-mobile)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.12.5)

### 1.12.4 (Released 2018-10-03)
While testing an update to Tidepool Mobile, we noticed an error that occurred when attempting to mouse over a time change icon. And this, my friends, is why we have a rigorous testing process.    
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/5stilew8/2-uncaught-typeerror-in-timechange)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.12.4)

### 1.12.3 (Released 2018-09-12)
We added timestamps to CGM data in your Daily View. With so many dots to keep track of, this should help keep things organized.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/QWz76ymx/16-s-data-viz-daily-view-cgm-add-timestamp-in-hover)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.12.3)

### 1.12.2 (Released 2018-09-11)
Our new Content Security Policy caused issues for people trying to create a Tidepool account on Safari. Sorry about that one, that's been fixed. (You still need to use Chrome to view the data.)  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/GbuHSNpr/13-csp-error-in-safari)

While we are working on an update to Tidepool Mobile, we noticed a bug that caused Tidepool Web to crash. It's nothing you would have encountered unless you are running a test build of Tidepool Mobile, but we fixed this nonetheless.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/VNKOkCOY/14-uncaught-typeerror-when-navigating-tidepool-web-after-uploading-via-mobile-bld-211-522)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.12.2)

### 1.12.1 (Released 2018-09-04)
We identified and resolved a bug that showed unnecessary scrollbars on our warning page in browsers that are not named Google Chrome.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/YHTZsl3m/3-scrollbars-in-browser-warning-page-on-safari)

We also identified and resolved a bug that displayed our fun loading animation for accounts with no data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/9GOEnw99/4-loading-dots-briefly-showing-over-the-upload-data-screen)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.12.1)

### 1.12.0 (Released 2018-08-28)
Our friends from Diabeloop submitted PRs to translate Tidepool Web into French. Le diabète, après tout, ne connaît pas de frontières.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/wJgM1E2H/48-tidepool-web-internationalization)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.12.0)

### 1.11.9 (Released 2018-08-22)
We found a bug that incorrectly reported basal suspends for Medtronic 600-series pumps. And promptly fixed it.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/uzlypSjy/46-tidepool-web-basics-page-shows-incorrect-suspend-count)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.11.9)

### 1.11.8 (Released 2018-08-09)
Care team members and clinicians can now set the site change source for accounts they are viewing if no preference has been selected, for the duration of their session.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/DVZk4lg8/41-new-card-allow-care-team-members-to-assign-infusion-site-change-rule)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.11.8)

### 1.11.7 (Released 2018-07-31)
In preparation for Medtronic 630G, 640G, and 670G support, we resolved a bug that incorrectly rounded delivered dosage data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/9ET8Bmh5/26-setting-6-series-bolus-increment-to-025-causes-loss-of-precision-due-to-rounding)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.11.7)

### 1.11.6 (Released 2018-07-31)
As part of our preparation for Medtronic 630G, 640G, and 670G support, we resolved a bug that incorrectly displayed some blood glucose readings as calibrations.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/u8Fid7Hi/23-600-series-bug-remove-calibration-yes-annotation)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.11.6)

### 1.11.5 (Released 2018-07-30)
A bug that showed too many decimal places in our print view came back, so we fixed it again.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/4vRWbVp3/20-daily-print-view-bg-tick-formatting-regression)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.11.5)

### 1.11.4 (Released 2018-07-19)
For clinicians logged into Tidepool, we've added an upload link in the header that launches the Tidepool Uploader (if it's installed). Sometimes little things like that make all the difference.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/W6P8MTyq/11-upload-links-on-careteam-accounts)

For our friends in Auto Mode, your bolus tooltips will show "Target: Auto" to make it clear that Auto Mode has the wheel.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/krrF6CmW/12-when-in-auto-mode-boluses-that-include-bg-data-list-target-null-in-the-tooltip)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.11.4)

### 1.11.2 (Released 2018-07-02)
We received an external contribution [from @rspier](https://github.com/rspier) to fix some formatting when you use Chrome's Print functionality (not our PDF fun).  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/OKhvKFnN/2-display-date-range-when-using-browser-print-functionality)

Turns out the Basal:Bolus ratio widget is still important to clinicians when looking at 670G data, so we added that back to the Basics view. Welcome back!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/NFKNjxyT/3-add-basalbolus-ratio-to-basics-view-for-automated-basal-devices)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.11.2)

### 1.11.1 (Released 2018-06-26)
Once we started putting our 670G visualization through the paces, we noticed a few scenarios that caused the Time in Auto Mode widget to be off in the Weekly view. We're looking to squash as many bugs as we can find before releasing this to the world, including this one.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Jpi5YurW/24-weekly-view-aggregated-stats-calculations-are-off)

Previously, there was no way to dismiss the prompt to download the Tidepool Uploader. A little X in the corner makes all the difference.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/XstB6XTv/25-add-a-dismiss-option-to-the-tidepool-uploader-launch-popup)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.11.1)

### 1.11.0 (Released 2018-06-19)
If we're going through all the trouble to upload your Medtronic 630G, 640G, and 670G data, it's got to look good, too.  

Auto mode is a great feature, but it needed a fresh design to stand out from Manual mode.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/AV4gpns3/16-change-how-viz-renders-auto-mode-for-670g-support)

When Auto mode is active during an upload, we'll include that schedule in your pump settings.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Ni2DGNEI/17-show-auto-mode-schedule-on-settings-view-when-is-active-at-time-of-upload)

There are a lot of different annotations and designations for blood glucose readings coming off a 670G. It took some time to sort it all out, but we're good now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/X5TCJYAZ/18-tideline-handle-annotations-for-600-series-smbgs)

Auto mode also means updating our basal labels on the Daily View.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/h1QqftJ6/19-map-for-auto-mode-and-regular-mode)

And adjusting the data we show in Basics to show Auto mode exits rather than every temp basal issued. We lost count at 1,000 when in Auto mode, so this seemed like a better solution. We will still show temp basal events in Manual mode, though.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/XwEYulG5/20-basal-events-in-basics-view-for-670g)

We added a "Time in Auto mode" widget to replace the Basal:Bolus ratio widget for 670G users. We hope you like it!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/nvJocRRd/21-viz-for-670-add-time-in-and-out-of-auto-mode-agg-stat-and-limit-basalbolus-ratio-agg-stats-to-manual-mode-only)

Here's an interesting bug we discovered (and fixed): While in Auto mode, if you suspend and then resume your pump, that suspend event was displaying as an Auto mode exit. We have to do a little more work to improve how that is visualized, but making sure your data is not misrepresented is the important bit. Polish will surely follow.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/UCwOXfD7/22-fix-auto-mode-suspends-so-that-they-occur-without-an-auto-mode-exit-as-indicated-from-pump-data)

An external contributor updated some of our documentation, and because we're an easy-going open source project, we've merged that pull request. Thanks [Mikael!](https://github.com/mrinnetmaki)  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Ms9tymZg/15-document-email-verification-bypass-key-for-docker-setup-in-blip-repo)

### 1.10.9 (Released 2018-06-07)
We found a bug that prevented a certain Tidepool Community Manager from logging into our demo accounts James and Jill Jellyfish (no relation). That's been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/4lnTETQg/4-cannot-log-in-to-jill-jellyfish-account)

An International Consensus Panel has updated recommended blood glucose thresholds. They seem pretty legit, so we've updated the default very low, low, in target, high, and very high thresholds for new accounts. Of course, you can change your target range to your liking any time you want.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/OKj6Qyji/5-update-glucose-defaults-to-reflect-standards)

While we were updating default thresholds, we noticed a bug that caused the y-axis labels on the daily view to disappear. Ah, the joys of writing code. We fixed that one too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/EJQHZnyv/6-bg-ticks-missing-in-daily-view-y-axis-for-mg-dl-display)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.9)

### 1.10.7 (Released 2018-05-14)
We’ve added the AADE Foundation to our Tidepool Big Data Donation Project Nonprofit Partner list. Now you can choose to support an organization providing resources to diabetes educators with your data donation.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LWBzvGMr/2-add-aade-foundation-to-tidepool-big-data-donation-project-nonprofit-partner-list)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.7)

### 1.10.5 (Released 2018-04-17)
We noticed when some of you created a new account and we displayed a message that says “Please click on the link in the email we sent you at (your email address)” and (your email address) would up on two lines if it was really long. We fixed that bug so now (your email address) shows up on its own line. Little details like that are important.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/67H081EV/8-put-the-email-address-on-its-own-line-so-it-doesnt-get-split)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.5)

### 1.10.4 (Released 2018-04-09)
Sometimes data lines in the Trends view would appear to loop around, like a weird connect-the-dots drawing. We fixed that.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/98DFbS3V/4-overlapping-lines-in-trends-view)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.4)

### 1.10.3 (Released 2018-03-29)
For users signing up for a new account, you can now see which email address you signed up with on our email verification page. If you accidentally typed in the wrong address (it happens to the best of us), you’ll know right away instead of wondering where that account verification email went.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1qAvkpEH/24-blip-show-email-address-as-part-of-signup-email-verification)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.3)

### 1.10.2 (Released 2018-03-28)
The printed Daily view started at 5:00pm rather than midnight. Sure, time zones are weird, but we fixed that so everyone’s day starts at a logical time.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/dr9EeALW/22-print-view-daily-view-starts-at-5pm-rather-than-midnight)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.2)

### 1.10.1 (Released 2018-03-19)
For anyone whose iPhone CGM upload is 8 weeks (or more) more recent than a pump upload, there was a small chance you may not be able to see any of your data based on how we process things behind the scenes. We cleaned up that order of operations and you can see your data again.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Inr3LmRc/18-cgm-only-from-dexcom-api-results-in-non-rendered-viz-due-to-data-paging)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.1)

### 1.10.0 (Released 2018-03-19)
Tired of watching those dots bounce while your data loads? Frustrated at seeing “Aw, snap!” if Tidepool gets bogged down by all the data you’ve uploaded? Welcome to Data Paging. We’ve reengineered how we visualize your data, reducing the time spent waiting for your data to load. Scrolling through the days/weeks is also faster, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/jmYSnJCw/15-tidepool-web-data-paging)

Along the way, we made some adjustments to how and where your bolus tooltips display.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/MI81nZVi/16-bolus-tooltips-are-displaying-below-the-basal-rates-in-daily-view)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.0)

### 1.9.9 (Released 2018-02-27)
Data with no above-target values caused the Y scale on our daily view to be off. That's not the way we should treat no-hitters - we fixed that bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1r7IxaiA/19-data-with-no-above-target-values-causes-y-scale-on-daily-view-to-be-off)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.9.9)

### 1.9.8 (Released 2018-02-23)
Introducing our Bolus Tooltip. This will help you identify the difference in insulin delivery for a meal or a correction. Hover over any bolus in the daily view to see all your pump settings and a breakdown of insulin delivered.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/vFjtdPcF/17-xl-data-viz-daily-differentiate-bolus-from-carbs-vs-bolus-from-correction)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.9.8)

### 1.9.7 (Released 2018-02-14)
We've added two new organizations you can support through the Tidepool Big Data Donation Project: DYF, and DiabetesSisters. We've also removed Diabetes Hands Foundation from the list of nonprofit organizations. We will miss their advocacy efforts, but are glad to see Beyond Type 1 pick up the baton and carry on their legacy.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/F056JnEQ/8-update-big-data-nonprofit-partners)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.9.7)

### 1.9.6 (Released 2018-02-14)
In the sign up process for people with diabetes between 13 and 17 years old, the text on the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use verification page said "you'll need to have a parent or guardian agree to the terms on the next screen"...which wasn't quite right. We fixed that to say "you'll need to have a parent or guardian agree to the terms below."  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/8iv5C67V/5-text-on-privacy-policy-tou-verification-page-should-change-from-next-screen-to-below)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.9.6)

### 1.9.5 (Released 2018-02-13)
In an effort to better respect and reflect the diversity of the Tidepool community, you can now indicate your diabetes diagnosis: type 1, type 2, gestational, pre-diabetes, LADA, parent, or other. It's optional, but it's also important.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/VyoPE9t0/4-xs-demographic-data-inclusion-phase-1)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.9.5)

### 1.9.4 (Released 2018-01-22)
Because the FreeStyle Libre only samples blood glucose data every 15 minutes instead of every 5 like other CGMs, our blood glucose distribution widget didn't factor in Libre data as CGM values. We've fixed that bug and adjusted the criteria for CGM data required for that widget. Sorry about that one.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/FNlDqd1A/11-libre-data-not-being-calculated-due-to-insufficient-data-points)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.9.4)

### 1.9.2 (Released 2018-01-04)
Folks trying to verify their Tidepool account that was initially created by their clinician were encountering an error message. For what it's worth, their account was still verified, but no one wants to see unwarranted error messages. We don't want to be the developers who cried wolf. That bug has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/HKrQyncg/2-error-when-home-verifying-a-vca-created-account)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.9.2)

### 1.9.1 (Released 2017-12-18)
As much as we love how your data looks in Tidepool, some people need to hold the data in their hands. So we've expanded our print feature to include Basics, the last six Daily views, and Device Settings.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/zdyHFY0M/8-l-blip-print-view-combined-basics-daily-settings)

Part of our work on the expanded print view included a fix to a bug that caused three-digit carb counts to be truncated. Sorry about that.
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/t777c7sr/10-daily-view-print-view-cannot-show-bolus-wizard-carb-counts-99g-only-shows-two-digits#)

Hovering on a blood glucose value in development mode would cause our app to crash. We don't want to treat our developers like that, so we fixed this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/6gwIwBIF/9-bugfix-for-redux-state-mutation-violation-crashes-app-in-dev-mode)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.9.1)

### 1.8.3 (Released 2017-11-30)
Our Daily Print View kept spinning for some accounts, like a perpetual merry-go-round. This bug has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/G3u35uCo/24-bug-print-option-fails-to-load-with-latest-release)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.8.3)

### 1.8.2 (Released 2017-11-29)
The initial text we used to promote the Dexcom API connection was a bit confusing. We gave that green banner a copy-edit. Hopefully this clears things up. Remember how we debuted this feature the day before? That's why we call this a "hot fix".  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1H3rwUBF/22-update-text-on-dexcom-api-banner)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.8.2)

### 1.8.1 (Released 2017-11-28)
We recently added the ability to connect your Dexcom account to Tidepool, automatically importing the data you upload to Dexcom Clarity. Most of this work happened on the back end, but we needed a way to easily notify you about this beyond emails, tweets, and Facebook posts. So here's a banner at the top of your page to keep you in the loop (you can dismiss it if you want, no worries.)  
[Feature Update](https://trello.com/c/YzpXRsNJ/16-dexcom-api-messaging-banner)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.8.1)

### 1.7.0 (Released 2017-11-06)
We noticed some legacy code that got in the way of our Dexcom API connection. That's been resolved now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/y3HJ5D4k/4-deployment-details-2017-11-06-dexcom-api)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

### 1.6.13 (Released 2017-10-24)
We updated the Bolus data on Basics to let you filter between override and underride boluses. The suggestion for manual boluses to be renamed to "letitride", however, was not approved.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pQaZdjad/21-data-viz-basics-distinguish-override-up-from-override-down)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.6.13)

### 1.6.12 (Released 2017-10-18)
We noticed a bug that displayed out of range CGM values as HI/LO and out of range blood glucose meter values as +1/-1 the threshold (for example, if the high threshold for a meter was 600, we would put the value at 601). In fixing this bug, we want these values to behave similarly, so now everything will display HI/LO or High/Low depending on the available space. Keeps things simple.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/p7L3RoNn/19-hi-lo-smbg-shows-actual-value-instead)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.6.12)

### 1.6.11 (Released 2017-10-17)
We used to only show data on Basics if you uploaded at least once from a supported insulin pump. That didn't seem fair to non-pumpers, so now we'll show relevant portions in Basics based on whatever you've uploaded.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/s3LiAYnA/5-s-blip-allow-basics-use-regardless-of-type-of-data-available)

An outside contributor submitted a quick fix for a link in one of our ReadMe files.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/vmZ1w6iG/7-fix-mocha-link-in-blip-readme)

Did we mention Tidepool is open source? We also added an outside contribution that fixed some of our development tools.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1tLMULDP/6-restore-dev-tools-by-default-in-blip)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.6.11)

### 1.6.8 (Released 2017-09-27)
With the release of Tidepool Mobile on iOS, we're updating references across the Tidepool platform, like this one after you've created your account and signed up for data storage.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/dkz5JMMg/39-xs-update-blip-notes-reference-to-tidepool-mobile-in-blip)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.6.8)

### 1.6.6 (Released 2017-09-18)
Continuing the post-Tidepool Uploader 2.0 launch, when you logged into your account, clicking "Upload" will either launch the Tidepool Uploader if you have it installed on your computer or prompt you to download the latest version of the Uploader if you haven't installed our software yet. Similarly, if you've installed the Tidepool Uploader before creating your account (kudos for jumping ahead in the fun), you'll be able to launch the Uploader from your browser after you've created your Data Storage Account. It only makes sense that the Upload links and buttons actually get you to the Uploader, right?  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/CTjNregM/36-490-electron-uploader-blip-integration)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.6.6)

### 1.6.2 (Released 2017-09-12)
Dear friends of Millie Mol, you can now change your display settings in your profile to display your blood glucose data in mmol/L.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/FJKBYCVt/28-proper-support-for-mmol-l)

When we first implemented the ability to display blood glucose data in mmol/L, it was a feature for internal-use only, and we noted a number of display bugs unique to that unit measurement. Along the way to rolling mmol/L out to all of you, we cleaned up those display bugs.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/iUicHdcW/29-blip-regression-display-bugs-when-in-mmoll-mode)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.6.2)

### 1.5.22 (Released 2017-09-07)
Tidepool is free for people with diabetes and clinicians. That won't change. But the sign up process is a little different for those groups - and the signup forms should reflect that. So, we've updated the signup forms for new accounts to better distinguish between patient and clinician users.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/yY5mTQjf/20-new-account-creation-forms-for-clinic-and-personal)

Because we love our developers (internal and external), we've made a bunch of improvements and fixes for the Docker development experience. Technically this isn't a user-facing update, but it doesn't hurt to remind you that we care about the engineering process and we value your feedback on stuff like this.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/PnIamSBO/21-improvements-and-fixes-for-the-docker-development-experience)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.5.22)

### 1.5.17 (Released 2017-08-30)
If you go more than 72 hours without a bolus from your insulin pump, we will hide the aggregated stats on our Basics view. Our previous threshold used to be 24 hours, be we decided to extended this out to a full 3-day vacation. Sometimes it's nice to take a break.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/4wrRxoqr/15-extend-24-hours-no-bolus-rule-on-basics-to-72-hours)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.5.17)

### 1.5.13 (Released 2017-08-16)
Time zone changes during a temp basal on supported Medtronic pumps were not treated with the utmost care. Yes, this is a highly specific scenario, but we can do better. This bug has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/bnEjgwgW/13-uploaderbug-medtronic-direct-upload-with-erics-pump-fails-platform-validation)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.5.13)

### 1.5.12 (Released 2017-08-07)
We added a banner to help existing users share their data with the Tidepool Big Data Donation Project. Sharing, after all, is caring.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/v8ovj43d/9-share-with-big-data-donation-ui-on-share-page)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.5.12)

### 1.5.10 (Released 2017-08-02)
Ordinarily, it's up to people with diabetes to share their data with their health care providers. But sometimes duplicate accounts are created and clinicians need to have the ability to remove those accounts from their patient list to minimize confusion. So we did that.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LIrmtf4i/5-remove-clinic-account-from-care-team)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.5.10)

### 1.5.7 (Released 2017-08-01)
We got reports that our PDF print view was rendering oddly in some applications. It took some sleuthing, but we've cleaned up our code and fixed those bugs. You're clear to print and save those PDFs to your heart and hard drive's content.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/oVpqm14o/3-pdfs-do-not-show-data-visualization-in-some-apps)

Along the way to fixing those PDF print view rendering bugs, we noticed that basal rates were showing up beyond the last upload time in the PDF print out. That was a bit presumptive of us, so now we're only showing basal data in print outs up to the last upload time.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/hLh5RXez/2-daily-print-view-renders-basal-beyond-the-latest-pump-data-upload-time)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.5.7)

### 1.5.5 (Released 2017-07-24)
When you log into your Tidepool account, we will show you the view (Trends, Basics, Weekly) with your most recent data. This should help you get to the good parts sooner.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/V8EvYZPi/27-m-people-get-confused-with-basics-date-being-pump-upload-date-when-they-have-more-recent-cgm-data)

Previously, clicking "Refresh" would sometimes cause an "infinite refresh" that never finished. Since the phrase "infinite crisis" was already in use elsewhere in pop culture, figured it was best to fix this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/3HKSQKm5/26-refresh-button-data-load-hangs-forever)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.5.5)

### 1.5.1 (Released 2017-07-06)
We get it, sometimes you want to hold your data in your hands. Now you can click the "Print" icon in the Daily view and generate a PDF of your last 6 days of uploaded data. This can be printed, or saved to an EHR, or used in some other creative way PDFs can be used. This is just the beginning - we have grand plans for this feature in the future.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/tjD655oz/2-l-blip-daily-print-view-first-production-release)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.5.1)

### 1.4.7 (Released 2017-06-21)
The "US/Pacific-New" timezone selection caused some trouble. Even though there isn't a realistic reason to use that timezone, the bug needs to be fixed to make sure data shows up as expected. And here we are.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/w6UgCOQS/13-blipbug-dexcom-data-disappearing-after-carelink-data-uploaded)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.4.7)

### 1.4.4 (Released 2017-06-21)
Creating clinician accounts used to be manual process. Now, it's automated. It's likely you won't appreciate this one nearly as much as we do, but it's still a worthy thing to document. We've also automated our welcome email to new clinician accounts as well. Yay automation!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/iYshJmxh/10-new-sign-up)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.4.4)

### 1.4.1 (Released 2017-06-06)
We're rolling out the ability to upload Medtronic data directly to Tidepool instead of importing from CareLink soon, this means we need to be able to deduplicate overlapping data. Your aggregate statistics are most appreciative of this update.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/3uyQGXo9/6-medtronic-direct-deduplication)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.4.1)

### 1.3.8 (Released 2017-05-23)
We reduced the number of clicks it takes to donate your data through the Tidepool Big Data Donation Project.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/ZnKDZhzv/10-improve-the-experience-sharing-with-big-data-donation-upon-tidepool-signup)

We added Medtronic-specific annotations to basal data to ensure you know your Medtronic data is, in fact, Medtronic data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/dwFcsbNp/11-add-support-for-medtronic-direct-specific-annotations)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.3.8)

### 1.3.4 (Released 2017-05-16)
A bunch of information on Device Settings disappeared after a recent release. Not sure how that happened, but we waved a wand (and fixed the bug) and brought that info back. Abracadabra!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Q15cxITp/7-bug-header-info-regression-on-device-settings-print-view)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.3.4)

### 1.3.3 (Released 2017-05-01)
One of our updates froze the Device Settings page for Tandem users. We thawed that one out and fixed that bug. Sorry about that one.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Tn72jJMW/2-viz-bug-view-settings-for-tandem-device-hangs-on-v0714)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.16.1)

### 2.16.0 (Released 2019-06-13)
We've updated our code signing certificates for the Windows version of Tidepool Uploader.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Uv8NwRg4/14-update-code-signing-certificates)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.16.0)

### 2.15.0 (Released 2019-06-10)
We've updated some of the text box formatting to clean things up. Our designers are much happier now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/qaC4V5bY/10-uploader-ui-bug-text-boxes-should-be-bigger)

Speaking of design, we've updated some additional error messages to properly convey what happens when Uploader is unable to make a connection, and we've rolled out a new font for Uploader to be consistent with how we do things on Tidepool Web and our marketing site, tidepool.org.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/wpXYglCD/9-electron-uploader-shows-misleading-error-message)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.15.0)

### 2.14.0 (Released 2019-04-26)
Often requested by our users, we now display scan events from the FreeStyle Libre in Tidepool Web. Now you can see when you're scanning that sensor, and what the value was for each scan.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/O9i3tqCA/60-uploader-upload-libre-scan-records-as-smbg-record)

We updated the error message that displays when a clinician tries to create a Tidepool account with an email address already associated with an existing Tidepool account. Little things like that are important.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/7HVJ9gUH/52-bug-uploader-not-handling-the-user-already-exists-error)

Continuing the user experience improvement train, the design of our Mac Installer has improved to be more explicit about the "drag this app into that folder" bit.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LpB6l0Sd/53-improve-usability-of-mac-dmg-installer)

And now we're rolling out more test environments to improve our development process, development builds of Tidepool Uploader need to access them.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/2wTVDU61/54-uploader-add-qa1-environment-to-uploader-server-list)

We created a script that automatically submits a notification to antivirus vendors like McAfee and Kaspersky when new versions of Tidepool Uploader are released.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Wv9TE21v/55-update-script-to-whitelist-with-kaspersky-and-mcafee-automatically)

We now store Omnipod IBF files in our "blob" service, which helps tremendously when we are troubleshooting reported bugs from our users. (We already do this for Medtronic uploads.)  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/4QWiAbBj/56-store-omnipod-ibfs-using-blob-service)

We used to record date and time change events from the Libre scanner as two separate time change events, when we want to have concurrent date and time change events appear as a single time change event in Tidepool Web. So we fixed that bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/gei6SOfn/57-uploader-libre-datetime-changes-are-stored-as-two-separate-time-change-events)

More on the Libre front, Tidepool Uploader used to display an unfriendly error when there was no data on a Libre scanner to upload. We've resolved that bug and now show a much more friendly error message.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/JZASCL2P/58-uploader-typeerror-when-there-are-no-records-on-a-libre)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.14.0)

### 2.13.0 (Released 2019-04-17)
This is fun. We've added a friendly pop up dialog that reminds users uploading Medtronic 600-series devices to accept the requested ad-hoc connection attempt on the pump itself.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/s7Oo8h3O/29-600-series-feature-add-ui-to-remind-user-to-accept-ad-hoc-connection-on-the-pump)

We improved our driver for Medtronic 600-series pumps ensuring pump history records stay intact between changes.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/WoixEsvg/28-600-series-driver-does-not-handle-changes-in-pump-history-correctly)

Tidepool Uploader now properly captures carbs that are entered in a bolus calculator without insulin delivery. Like if you're treating a low.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/dZsluC3F/30-bug-carbs-not-visualized-for-calculator-bolus-that-includes-carbs-but-no-insulin-delivery)

We improved unit tests for supported Medtronic 500/700-series pumps to make sure we're checking the full range of settings every time we work on a new version of Tidepool Uploader.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/eHfq035X/32-add-comprehensive-data-parsing-unit-tests-for-medtronic-5-7-series-devices)

While we're at it, we improved unit tests for supported Medtronic 600-series pumps, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/SGVkYfHa/31-uploader-add-comprehensive-data-parsing-unit-tests-for-medtronic-6-series-devices)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.13.0)

### 2.12.1 (Released 2019-04-17)
Coming in hot, we fixed a bug that caused some TrueMetrix meter uploads to fail. Sorry about that one!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/vHqdHJVc/26-truemetrix-error-checksums-not-matching)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.12.1)

### 2.12.0 (Released 2019-03-13)
Any day we can add support for new devices is a good day. We'd like to welcome Roche's Accu-Chek Aviva Connect and Guide blood glucose meters to the fun. You can now upload your blood glucose data from those meters using the latest version of Tidepool Uploader.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LJRUheVG/12-v2120-roche-accu-chek-meters)

LZO is a lossless data compression algorithm that we use to help move your data from Medtronic 600-series pumps to your Tidepool account quickly. Open source advocates may have noticed we were previously using a library with a GPL-licensed implementation. Now we're running an LGPL-based implementation of LZO.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/IMEQd5Pm/10-v2120-find-use-non-gpl-lzo-library-for-uploader)

We noticed an issue with Tandem t:slim X2 pumps with CGM data when regular readings that occurred every five minutes and Backfill values were overlapping and they weren't getting deduplicated because their timestamps were not identical. Thankfully, this has now been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/KOMs7WP2/11-v2120-tandem-x2-importing-duplicate-cgm-values)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.12.0)

### 2.11.0 (Released 2019-02-20)
It's another bug bash bonanza!

Insulin on board (IOB) for Omnipod uploads was not shown when either the meal or correction IOB was zero. That's been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/tWxKUIcy/17-v2110-omnipod-iob-possibly-miscalculated)

We also addressed instances where device settings on Medtronic 5/7 series pumps were wonky and unexpected. Wonky is a technical term, btw.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/lCuz9PZ5/18-v2110-medtronic-5-7-series-could-not-find-bolus-wizard-settings)

For Tandem pumps that haven't been uploaded in a while, uploads would freeze at 16%. Now that that's been fixed, we'd like to welcome back your lovely t:slim data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/i9Dhg0VO/19-v2110-tandem-16-upload-failure)

Sometimes we match up automated suspend events with the wrong automated resume event, which caused all sorts of problems. If you want to get technical, this is called a "negative duration"...anyway, that's fixed, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/GI0fUhFD/20-v2110-negative-duration-for-automated-suspend-resume)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.11.0)

### 2.10.1 (Released 2019-01-30)
You may think dependency updates are not exciting, but without this work, all the fun things we have planned for the future aren't possible. Trust me, this is exciting stuff.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/2DYR2Xlx/14-update-dependencies-including-electron-v3)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.10.1)

### 2.9.1 (Released 2018-12-21)
Coming in hot! We fixed a bug with older Medtronic pumps that incorrectly displayed ISF higher than 256 in bolus tooltips in the Daily View.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/mcr0cwa0/39-isf-s-way-off-in-device-settings)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.9.1)

### 2.9.0 (Released 2018-12-17)
After we finally figured out the exact series of incantations required by Microsoft to grant us the right permissions, Tidepool Uploader now supports Verio and Verio Flex meters on Windows.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/QvV3uNlH/31-uploader-verio-verio-flex-on-windows)

Tidepool Uploader used to get upset if it tried to read the Active Time Insulin setting on a Medtronic pump that didn't have the bolus wizard enabled. This bug has been resolved, and Tidepool Uploader is much happier now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/oMvCEXJV/32-dont-read-active-insulin-time-pre-bolus-wizard-medtronic-5-7-series)

Tidepool Uploader also used to get upset when it encountered corrupted data on Tandem pumps. We've updated the driver to avoid corrupted data, paving the way for more successful uploads.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/WsbPV97L/33-tandem-driver-gets-stuck-when-packets-are-corrupted)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

### 2.8.6 (Released 2018-11-26)
We've added a silent option for the Windows installer allowing Tidepool Uploader to be installed from the command line. IT staff at clinics using Tidepool will really appreciate this one.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/aFhdUDcq/16-windows-installer-for-uploader-should-install-usb-driver-silently)

We changed how Tidepool Uploader handles the "matching bolus wizard for bolus event not found" scenario. Uploads for Medtronic 600-series pumps should be a bit more graceful now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/bZMPsQYV/17-600-series-upload-error-matching-bolus-wizard-for-bolus-event-not-found)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.8.6)

### 2.8.4 (Released 2018-11-01)
Older Medtronic pumps with a whole lot of CGM data (32 pages, to be precise) would only upload the most recent page of data for a delta upload (reminder: delta uploads are uploads that only consist of new data). This bug has been fixed, and now Tidepool Uploader will capture all CGM data on older Medtronic pumps since the last upload.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/yRKhiyqw/2-5-7-series-only-most-recent-cgm-data-with-delta-upload-if-more-than-32-pages-of-cgm-data-available)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.8.4)

### 2.8.3 (Released 2018-10-25)
We identified a bug that prevented users attempting to upload Verio and Verio Flex meters on macOS Mojave. The fix? On Mojave, there's an extra space in a driver path that we were looking for...seriously. This bug is squashed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/VsEy6yN2/25-verio-verio-flex-not-uploading-on-macos-mojave)

Tidepool Uploader is now bringing in additional pump settings for supported insulin pumps. Now we can get to work on displaying those additional settings in Tidepool Web. Stay tuned!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/7hyUrl24/24-additional-pump-settings)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.8.3)

### 2.8.0 (Released 2018-10-18)
We found that initial uploads for Medtronic 630G, 640G, and 670G were taking a bit longer than we would like, especially for folks uploading in a clinic. So we added a 4-week filter to for Medtronic 630G, 640G, and 670G uploads. This should move things along nicely.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/DTDsGtkK/11-add-4-weeks-filter-to-tidepool-uploader-for-medtronic-600-series-uploads)

Here's the thing: Sometimes you don't notice those requests to install or approve drivers from a new piece of software. It happens. The problem is, if those drivers for Tidepool Uploader aren't installed some of your devices won't upload. That's no fun. Now Tidepool Uploader on macOS will fall back to user-space drivers we wrote that will support Animas pumps, and Ultra2, Ultra Mini, or VerioIQ meters if we detect the original drivers were not installed. Pretty cool, huh?  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/nabqaof0/10-devices-apple-high-sierra-kernel-extension-issues)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.8.0)

### 2.7.7 (Released 2018-10-11)
Attention folks running Tandem's new Basal-IQ feature, Tidepool Uploader now supports your fancy new automatic basal suspend events. We're also able to upload Dexcom G6 data coming off a t:slim X2. Your Friendly Neighborhood Tidepool Community Manager is particularly excited about this one.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/fNigcnTf/7-tandem-predictive-low-glucose-suspend)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.7.7)

### 2.7.6 (Released 2018-09-13)
We fixed a bug in our blob storage service that tried to send an empty data field to our database. Why send an empty box when you can just save on postage and send nothing at all?  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/0IAOAEXl/19-uploader-shouldnt-send-clientprivate-when-theres-no-content)

We linked Rollbar with our support ticketing system, which is great! But it wasn't always linking the email address that generated a Rollbar error, which was not great! But now we fixed that and now we'll be able to see usernames with Rollbar errors, which will help us troubleshoot future problems, which is great!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/NAUHEvHf/18-rollbar-should-always-record-username)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.7.6)

### 2.7.5 (Released 2018-09-06)
It's another bug bash bonanza!  

HID errors will now fail more gracefully. Admittedly, this is an awkward concept to wrap your head around, but this will help us figure out what is really going on.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/i95g40KF/7-uncaught-error-cannot-write-to-hid-device)

We fixed a bug that caused an error if an upload only included the second part of a dual bolus. Glad that's settled.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/9mr5tbHX/8-5-7-series-error-details-expected-a-square-bolus-but-found-type-4)

And, we fixed a bug that occurred when a 24-hour temporary basal rate was followed by a basal suspend.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/dtJAGcvz/9-5-7-series-if-a-24-hour-temp-basal-is-followed-by-a-suspend-the-duration-of-the-temp-basal-is-incorrect)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.7.5)

### 2.7.4 (Released 2018-08-10)
The Tidepool Uploader now saves not only processed data, but also the raw binary data retrieved from FreeStyle Libre and all supported Medtronic pumps. The data is stored in a secure location for our engineers to access when it's time to squash some bugs or if re-processing is required. Between this and Rollbar support we added last November, turnaround times from us on bug fixes should improve tremendously.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/DMgzvGOL/39-store-upload-blobs)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.7.4)

### 2.7.3 (Released 2018-08-06)
A few of our external beta tests identified some new bugs once 2.7.2 went live. This is why we test.  

If the first basal event found in the pump history was a temp basal start event without a proper scheduled basal start event, things went wrong. We fixed this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/7hNQG2qR/34-600-series-bug-dont-create-temp-basals-when-missing-suppressed-basal-info)

If the first basal event found in the pump history was a suspend event, things went wrong. We fixed this bug, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/FQ2o9TgH/35-600-series-bug-throw-away-any-isolated-initial-suspends)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.7.3)

### 2.7.2 (Released 2018-08-01)
At last, Tidepool fully supports Medtronic MiniMed 630G, 640G, and 670G. As you can imagine, a lot of work went into this one. How much work, you ask? (Deep breath)  

The Tidepool Uploader needed to convert 670G micro boluses in auto mode to basal rates.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/SmmJ2c2W/2-update-uploader-to-support-auto-mode-for-670g)

And handles low glucose suspend events properly.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pPZVg7BE/11-6-series-lgs)

A lot of work went into the messaging and error handling around our ad-hoc pairing functionality.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/6ESCkbTM/5-600-series-bug-throw-an-error-when-attempting-to-use-ad-hoc-pairing-with-a-linked-meter)

Medtronic 630G, 640G, and 670G also benefits from our "delta upload" functionality. This means after the first upload, future uploads go by much quicker since we're only capturing new data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/K4dHbrSj/9-s-new-card-6-series-delta-upload)

We ensured the raw data coming off 670G is preserved.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/WZbBxkXA/7-670g-add-raw-microbolus-data-to-payload-field-of-basal-data-type)

Including the entire basal history.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/YM1TDo7Q/14-498-medtronic-6-history-message-basals-ux0-dev3-tst5)

Even when the basal schedule is...a lot.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/RWhAGJze/15-large-basal-schedules-should-not-cause-upload-failure)

The manual bolus history? We're getting all of that.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/asHiqHmq/18-502-medtronic-6-history-message-manual-bolus-ux0-dev3-tst3)

Bolus calculator history, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pdOnbBwT/20-501-medtronic-6-history-message-calculator-bolus-ux0-dev5-tst3)

And all those recorded and reported blood glucose readings? Yup.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/BHVmZoHh/19-500-medtronic-6-history-message-smbg-values-ux0-dev3-tst3)

Can't forget about reservoir changes and prime event history, can we?  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/YwljcNPd/21-uploader-6-series-rewind-prime-device-events)

CGM data? You're coming too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/HNi2st5n/29-497-medtronic-6-history-message-cgm-data-ux0-dev3-tst3)

No matter what time zone you live in, our UTC bootstrapping algorithm will ensure your data is in sync.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/vwaKLzuT/17-test-medtronic-6-utc-bootstrapping)

Our time check feature also helps with that.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/0bEUjkmz/25-xs-new-card-6-series-time-check)

New images and UI components were added to the Uploader for a paired and unpaired Contour Next Link 2.4 meter.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/9LBpSPxH/4-new-images-for-6-series-ui)

This includes a proper option to select in the "Choose Devices" section.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/BF1URAvH/31-494-s-uploader-medtronic-6-driver-copy-for-choose-devices-screen)

All of those data points need to be displayed correctly on the Basics view.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/JgH7y7VY/26-6-series-basics-page)

Device settings also are properly displayed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/JkZGdYaS/28-6-series-device-settings)

Including all the different basal schedule profiles.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/CwJHioPO/32-504-medtronic-6-1b-implement-basal-profiles-ux0-dev3-tst1)

Over the course of internal and beta testing we documented and resolved a handful of bugs. Ready for those?  

We documented and resolved a bug that showed a previously scheduled basal extending into Auto Mode time if Auto Mode started with no insulin delivery.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/sYxXIylr/3-if-auto-mode-starts-with-no-microbolus-delivery-data-is-incorrect)

We also documented and resolved a bug that displayed temp basals during an upload as a scheduled basal.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/fk1vqCBz/6-uploader-600-series-when-a-temp-basal-starts-before-an-upload-data-is-uploaded-incorrectly)

To ensure we don't lose any raw data, we took extra measures to capture all of the microbolus data from 670G pumps.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/WZbBxkXA/7-670g-add-raw-microbolus-data-to-payload-field-of-basal-data-type)

We documented and resolved a bug that noted carb entries for a bolus were not being clearly identified with their respective bolus.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/hZSvQjMZ/10-daily-view-carb-circle-misaligned-with-related-bolus-bar)

We documented and resolved a bug that showed all blood glucose readings as linked even if they were manually entered.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/PTvtwFk1/12-on-the-630g-all-bg-readings-show-up-as-linked-even-when-manually-entered)

That one also impacted data displayed on Basics, but we fixed that, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/jnkv0yVy/24-multiple-bg-readings-showing-in-the-basics-view-for-each-actual-bg-reading)

We documented and resolved a bug that incorrectly visualized suspended basal events.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/T5x6YSN7/13-6-series-bug-basal-suspend-gaps-missing-from-daily-view)

We documented and resolved a bug that prevented a successful upload during an extended bolus.

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.7.2)

### 2.6.5 (Released 2018-07-24)
It's another Bug Fix Bonanza™! This this round is devoted to supported Medtronic 5/7 pumps.  

We fixed a bug for pumpers who use dual/square boluses without extending their bolus (100%/0%).  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/3zeww3MJ/14-error-details-expected-a-normal-bolus-but-found-type-4-or-5)

We fixed a bug that inelegantly handled how we display scheduled basal rates after a 24-hour temp basals. Things are much more elegant now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/KToTSpZx/15-after-a-24-hour-temp-basal-resuming-scheduled-basal-sometimes-missing-in-5-7-series-pump-history)

We used to have problems with temp basals that were set to 0%. That's been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/RVSAh1aT/16-uploader-medronic-direct-no-rate-for-temp-basal-uploading-data-to-platform-failed)

Turns out CGM time change records can go "missing" if the pump has been switched off for a long time. We now handle this more gracefully.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/ow0JdtX9/17-missing-cgm-time-change-records-for-5-7-series)

And more dependency updates! Trust us, these are important.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/juzkA0SF/18-uploader-another-round-of-dependency-updates)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.6.5)

### 2.6.4 (Released 2018-07-11)
We noticed a bug that prevented all data from OneTouch Ultra 2 meters from being uploaded. Those readings can't hide from us! This has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/m1Q6G5UO/5-ultra-2-not-uploading-all-available-data-on-meter)

For third party developers, and our own sanity, we added "cgm" device tags to upload records for pumps that integrate CGM data. (Waves to compatible Animas, Tandem, and Medtronic pumps!)  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/W9oys1cy/6-uploader-add-cgm-to-devicetags-for-the-relevant-insulin-pumps-eg-tandem-g4-and-x2)

We also added a hotfix that addresses a frozen Uploader if the backend returns an error.  
[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.6.4)

### 2.6.2 (Released 2018-06-13)
We fixed some of our code that deals with identifying the right time for your data. If you really want to dig into our UTC Bootstrapping algorithm, send us an email and we'll talk your ear off about the challenges of device times.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/rh2oLpjR/8-apply-utc-bootstrapping-fix-for-invalid-timezone-offset-to-new-data)

We're running on node-serialport v6 now. You may not think that's exciting, but it fixes a bunch of issues for devices that connect through a serial port on Windows. And you thought dependency updates were boring? We now also automatically retry a serial port upload if it fails the first time. Boom!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/ucvNt5d0/9-update-node-serialport-to-version-6)

We fixed a bug in the OneTouch Ultra 2 driver which could cause some uploads to fail.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/o8yPVF7v/10-onetouch-ultra-2-typeerror-details-cannot-read-property-length-of-null)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.6.2)

### 2.6.0 (Released 2018-06-04)
Tidepool now supports Trividia Health True Metrix, True Metrix Go, and True Metrix Air blood glucose meters. If you're looking to upload one of those meters, we've combined them all under _Trividia Health True Metrix_ label in our devices list. Keeps things nice and tidy.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/OFkyZUe6/2-uploader-trividia-true-metrix-meters)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.6.0)

### 2.5.13 (Released 2018-05-31)
Currently we import IOB data from Medtronic pumps from the Bolus Wizard Estimate of Active Insulin. However, if a manual bolus or a square wave bolus is done without the Bolus Wizard, we don't get the IOB information. This data is listed at Unabsorbed insulin and is separate from the Bolus Wizard data. Medtronic also does not include active insulin data for any Bolus Wizard boluses without an associated BG value, despite it being listed in Unabsorbed insulin. By importing Unabsorbed insulin instead of Active insulin we will be able to provide our users with more data. All of this to say we fixed that bug and now use "Unabsorbed Insulin" instead of "Active Insulin" to display IOB.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/0jpKslMv/23-change-iob-data-from-medtronic-from-active-insulin-to-unabsorbed-insulin)

We’ve made more improvements to our Uploader error-logging service, Rollbar, this time to log data anomalies for any events with a time significantly in the past or future. Time travel isn't real (yet), this update should help us understand why some uploads have a date that is way, way off.  
Feature Requirements  
[Part 1](https://trello.com/c/HFxhx2Kh/22-log-data-anomalies-to-rollbar-for-any-events-with-time-field-significantly-in-past-or-future), [Part 2](https://trello.com/c/VhJD2moG/24-add-a-rollbar-notification-for-when-a-user-gets-the-timezone-conflict-message)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.13)

### 2.5.11 (Released 2018-05-16)
Tidepool now supports Medtronic Veo (554/754) insulin pumps. Yay!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/RU2SjKA1/7-uploader-support-medtronic-veo-554-754-pump)

Bayer was acquired by Ascencia, which means all those Contour meters needed some new branding. We’ve gone with Ascencia (Bayer) to minimize confusion.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/mt2xb3qV/6-update-bayer-listing-to-ascencia-bayer)

Our friends at Medtronic removed the ability to export your data as a CSV file. We relied on that functionality to import your CareLink data into Tidepool. As a result, we’ve removed the “Upload from CareLink option in the Tidepool Uploader” (Don’t worry, you can still upload directly to Tidepool with your Contour Next Link meter.)  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pz3ltLai/4-remove-upload-from-carelink-option)

Previously, if two consecutive square wave calculator boluses were given on a Medtronic 530G, the Tidepool Uploader interpreted the data as a single Dual Wave bolus with the extended portion of the bolus being the insulin total from the first bolus, which is listed as an override of the total. Also, if the last bolus on the 530G was a square wave bolus, data uploads failed. It’s hip to be square, but not that square - we’ve fixed both those bugs.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/izgIetxG/5-2-consecutive-square-calculator-boluses-are-merged-into-a-single-bolus-when-uploaded-from-medtronic-530g)

Finally, if an account was set up to upload devices on one operating system, you’d see “Unknown Device” on an operating system that does not support those devices. That bug has been squashed. We will remove that device from your upload options so it doesn’t look like you’re trying to upload mystery data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/6XAazELZ/8-unknown-devices-appearing-in-uploader)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.11)

### 2.5.9 (Released 2018-04-26)
We changed some of the text for our Time Check pop up to make it clear that you should triple-check the time on the device you’re trying to upload. This is somewhere between a bug fix and a new feature. Feature fix?  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/ERwBfwRa/19-update-device-time-check-copy)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.9)

### 2.5.8 (Released 2018-04-26)
Dependency updates aren’t always the most exciting thing, but we want to make sure you’re getting the latest and greatest software possible, so here we are with some shiny new code under the hood of the Tidepool Uploader.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LLQU6QaX/17-new-card-uploader-dependency-updates)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.8)

### 2.5.7 (Released 2018-04-23)
Remember when we said we fixed that bug that prevented all your Libre data from uploading. This time we really, really fixed it. (To be fair, the FreeStyle Libre hasn’t been out that long, so it took a little time for larger datasets to come our way and push the boundaries of our code.)  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/UUfpJcP2/10-reading-all-the-available-data-from-a-libre-device)

For our friends with a Medtronic pump using more than 6 or 7 insulin sensitivities or carb ratios, your uploads used to fail. We fixed that bug too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/MyWefnN2/11-upload-fails-when-a-large-number-of-insulin-sensitivities-or-carb-ratios-are-specified)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.7)

### 2.5.5 (Released 2018-04-10)
Be honest, how diligent are you at keeping your devices on time when you travel? The Tidepool Uploader will now warn you if it detects a difference between the time zone selected and the time indicated on your device.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1eAw2Fpc/2-uploader-timezones-as-a-user-i-want-the-uploader-to-warn-me-of-any-difference-between-my-device-time-and-computer-time-or-select)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.5)

### 2.5.4 (Released 2018-03-27)
We found a bug that prevented every last data point on your FreeStyle Libre from uploading. That won’t be a problem anymore.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/5KPT5Iim/20-libre-uploading-with-gaps-in-data)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.4)

### 2.5.3 (Released 2018-03-16)
We’ve made improvements to our Uploader error-logging service, Rollbar to catch more hiccups and bummers that you throw our way. This will go a long way to helping us identify areas we can improve our software.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/144Btqt7/13-uploader-improve-rollbar-logging)

Omnipod device settings were hell-bent on displaying as mg/dL even when uploaded from a pump set to mmol/L. We’d like to formally apologize to our friends who prefer blood glucose concentrations measured by molarity instead of weight - this bug has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/KVEO8OTR/12-omnipod-showing-mg-dl-in-device-settings-even-after-mmol-l-selected-in-user-profile)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.3)

### 2.5.1 (Released 2018-03-12)
We gave upload times for Medtronic and Tandem pumps a serious speed boost. Prior to this update, we would pull all data off compatible Medtronic and Tandem pumps and sort out duplicate data later. Now, initial uploads of compatible Tandem and Medtronic pumps will show “We've improved how devices upload. This upload will take longer than usual, but your future uploads will be much, much faster.” After that, we will only upload new data. The result? A bolus from the Speed Force and much faster uploads in the future.  
Feature Requirements  
[Part 1](https://trello.com/c/gwB5pykC/3-uploader-delta-upload-ui), [Part 2](https://trello.com/c/5i0sM0wx/4-m-delta-uploads-3-of-4-medtronic-5-series), [Part 3](https://trello.com/c/ieSwFQq5/5-m-delta-uploads-4-of-4-tandem) 

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.1)

### 2.4.0 (Released 2018-02-22)
Tidepool now supports the Bayer Contour Next One blood glucose meter on Windows and Mac, and OneTouch Verio and Verio Flex blood glucose meters on Mac. (We're working on adding support for those two meters for our friends running Windows, stay tuned.)  
Feature Requirements  
[Part 1](https://trello.com/c/XGNCkEmk/14-add-support-for-bayer-contour-next-one), [Part 2](https://trello.com/c/UhxOg1zZ/15-uploader-onetouch-verio-and-verio-flex)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.4.0)

### 2.3.0 (Released 2018-02-15)
Clinicians and clinical study investigators, this one is for you: Tidepool now supports Abbott's FreeStyle Libre Pro.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/2sVdsOOU/10-libre-pro)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.3.0)

### 2.2.5 (Released 2018-01-08)
This is a bug bash bonanza.  

We were notified of a bug that generated a "could not find basal schedule" error that was caused by a basal rate created for pizza. We affectionately called this the "Pizza Basal Bug". This has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirement](https://trello.com/c/0yXu3EPF/9-pizza-basal-bug)

Medtronic 5/7 series pumps can create "other" markers. That was news to us. We've fixed that bug so incoming "other" markers don't mess with your uploads.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/heVgxuHy/8-unknown-medtronic-direct-record-type)

We identified a bug in the UltraMini driver that calls a callback twice after a successful upload. A trivial bug fix, but a bug fix nonetheless.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/DhwgWqsi/7-ultramini-callback-was-already-called)

Animas uploads were getting fussy after a recent dependacy update. We've addressed this bug by adding functionality to resume a dropped connection.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/re4NHbSw/6-animas-uncaught-typeerror-commandpacketparser-is-not-a-function)

We were storing CGM values that were currently displayed on a Tandem t:slim G4 instead of the calibrated CGM value that was entered. That's our bad. We've fixed this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/VIhtCzG5/5-tandem-calibration-values-show-cgm-value-instead-of-calibration-value)

We noticed when a Tandem temporary basal crossed into a new scheduled basal segment we only stored the rate and not the percentage. Best to keep things consistent - we fixed that bug and now temporary basals display as expected.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/zGZ65BOr/4-tandem-temp-basal-display-bug)

Well...that was productive.  
[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.2.5)

### 2.2.4 (Released 2017-12-21)
Turns out a Precision Xtra meter needs a little more time than we initially thought to upload more than 400 blood glucose readings. We fixed that bug and upped the timeout time from 10 to 20 seconds.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/NRFZHzbo/16-uploader-pxtra-times-out-if-there-are-many-bg-records-on-the-meter)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.2.4)

### 2.2.3 (Released 2017-12-12)
The Dexcom driver doesn't always handle error communication gracefully. We've addressed this bug by adding a little more context in case an upload cable gets disconnected.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/X5Y3bDP7/3-uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-attrs-of-null)

FreeStyle Lite uploads were hanging up a bit. We poked around and fixed the bug causing this.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/3lCJF3qM/4-freestyle-lite-upload-sometimes-hangs-at-70)

We found a bug that caused a minor hubub when a Clinician account tried to load a patient profile that generated an error. We cleaned that up - things should operate smoothly now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LMqqMx1x/5-errored-user-profile-still-being-added-to-available-upload-groups)

Turns out, Low Glucose Suspend events on Medtronic pumps could have three or fewer records to represent the event. We found a bug that included the assumption that LGS events had exactly three records. You know what happens when you assume...this has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/vKfxm83B/2-uploader-error-suspend-resume-events-out-of-order)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.2.3)

### 2.2.2 (Released 2017-11-29)
It's hard to make dependency updates sound interesting, even though they're super important. You're going to have to trust us on this one, this stuff is a big deal.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/kTDfWrzS/18-492-l-uploader-update-dependencies)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.2.2)

### 2.2.1 (Released 2017-11-17)
While the phrase "brand consolidation" makes us feel queasy, we do need to simplify things a bit. Since the name "Blip" is not a thing anymore, we changed the "Go to Blip" button to read "See data".  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/WU728Ih2/8-xs-rebrand-blip-to-tidepool-uploader)

We fixed a single line of code that caused Precision Xtra uploads to fail. Yes, literally a single line of code.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/PZzb3Ch2/7-precision-xtra-upload-fails)

Our time change algorithm didn't like a particular default date that could be set in Medtronic pumps. We've fixed that bug so everyone can play nice again.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/wonZCRNy/9-532-missing-time-change-record-on-530g)

If a percentage temporary basal rate was the first record on a Medtronic pump, the Tidepool Uploader was not happy. With this bug fix, the Uploader has improved its morale.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/RiSWtcG1/10-medtronic-direct-temp-basal-has-missing-rate)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.2.1)

### 2.2.0 (Released 2017-11-03)
Tidepool now supports Abbott's FreeStyle Libre. Woohoo! You have no idea how long we spent discussing the nuance and semantics between continuous and flash glucose monitoring.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/XMchviCK/2-521-uploader-abbott-freestyle-libre)

We've added a new feature called _Rollbar_ which automatically sends us error reports when something goes wrong. The entire team is quite excited about this one. You can expect a lot more bug fixes in the future.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/cYSNiB1W/3-uploader-send-error-reports-automatically)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.2.0)

Tidepool now supports OneTouch Ultra 2 and UltraMini meters. Welcome to the fun!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/drBwiv9K/15-522-onetouch-ultra-2-and-onetouch-mini)

We added a super secret toggle that enables Debug Mode, which helps us troubleshoot issues that are reported to us. It's not actually super secret, but you don't need to worry about it unless something goes wrong and we ask you to do it. Speaking of help, if you ever run into problems, [support@tidepool.org](mailto:support@tidepool.org) is your best way to get in touch.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/jo0EfNg2/14-uploader-unify-dev-prod-build)

Our recent update to Electron means we can do fun things like support multiple cables for a single device. This means 3rd party cables can be used to upload, for example, supported Abbott meters.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/mE0Q860H/16-519-electron-support-multiple-usb-pid-vid-combos-per-driver)

Using Electron also means we can simplify options on the Choose Device screen. So we did that and combined all the different Contour Next meters as well as Abbott FreeStyle Lite and Freedom Lite to single options. As always, neat and tidy is the goal.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/06aRAIAq/17-uploader-collapse-bayer-meters-into-a-single-bayer-contour-selection-prevent-unknown-device)

We addressed two bugs causing unexpected data from Medtronic pumps. One was an assumption there would always be at least one basal record on a pump. The other resolved an issue we noticed when pump basal schedules get reset after a pump error.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/TWzhnHRM/13-pump-errors-cause-unexpected-data-on-pump)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

### 2.0.2 (Released 2017-09-15)
In our continued effort to support the entire suite of Tandem products, the Tidepool Uploader will now upload Dexcom G5 data from a t:slim X2 pump.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/aKu0nzdf/31-511-uploader-add-g5-support-for-tandem-pumps)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.0.2)

### 2.0.1 (Released 2017-09-08)
We noticed links in the Uploader were crashing computers running 32-bit versions of Windows. Sorry about that. We've fixed that bug and you can resume clicking away to your heart's content.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/FFKssPse/23-518-uploader-windows-32-crashes-when-clicking-on-most-links-like-the-footer)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.0.1)

### 2.0.0 (Released 2017-09-06)
Introducing Tidepool Uploader 2.0. It's a stand-alone application that sets the stage for some ambitious improvements down the road (scroll up to see what we mean). We'll document the work behind each of the Feature Requirements below, but trust that this is an incredibly big deal and we're so happy to deliver this new and improved experience to the diabetes community.  

The Tidepool Uploader works on Mac and Windows.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/A86J1Lbt/8-485-electron-uploader-develop-installer-for-mac-and-windows)

It still supports all the devices you've come to enjoy connecting to Tidepool.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/AxAexUcA/10-486-electron-uploader-device-support)

The new Tidepool Uploader runs on Electron, which means a lot of work went into moving our code.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/RzFYcXyz/17-503-1ux-5dev-3tst-uploader-electron-uploader-part-2)

We gave the login screen a bit of a makeover.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/HOJrre0z/14-495-s-1ux-3dev-1tst-electron-uploader-update-tidepool-uploader-login-screen-footer)

The Tidepool Uploader now supports direct uploading of supported Medtronic insulin pumps (523, 530G, 723). You'll need a Contour Next Link meter to make that happen.  
Feature Requirements [Part 1](https://trello.com/c/8nJtBvT7/7-482-update-error-message-for-medtronic-direct-5-series), [Part 2](https://trello.com/c/hYZjKBPK/6-505-electron-uploader-encrypt-and-store-locally-the-users-medtronic-serial-number)

The new Tidepool Uploader will automatically check for new updates.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/iwNjYKJn/16-491-electron-uploader-auto-update-for-tidepool-uploader)

We rounded off the Tidepool Uploader icon, because that's what the modern web design textbooks suggested. But we're keeping all the vowels in our name.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/XpgO8bbO/5-new-icon-for-tidepool-uploader)

Menu items link out where you expect them to.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/JfZWcESh/13-uploader-20-help-menu)

Support for importing your Medtronic data from CareLink will go away eventually, so we reordered the devices list a bit to set the stage.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/UkEO5ymQ/3-478-electron-uploader-move-carelink-checkbox-to-bottom-of-list)

We added a fun little chime when your upload completes, and a fun, but more somber tone if it fails.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/faV0ToYq/4-electron-uploader-should-have-notification-sounds-earcons-for-upload-complete-upload-failed)

The Mac Installer needed some love, so we splashed a bucket of Tidepool-inspired paint on it.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/i5r0UVTT/40-uploader-20-mac-installer-branding)

And we updated the metrics the Tidepool Uploader reports so we can better understand all of you fine people and how you're using our software.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/cbseB9qW/12-489-xs-electron-uploader-kissmetrics)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

### 0.312.0 (Released 2017-09-01)
We received a bug report including the phrase "Timestamps must be in order". We've applied the proper sorting method and fixed this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/tFZ5mrMN/1-uploaderbug-470-medtronic-direct-bugfixes)

The Tidepool Uploader is no longer in beta. We're in the big time now, folks. Let's remove that "beta" label from here on out, shall we?  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/3fRwxot6/2-481-uploader-remove-beta-from-production-uploader)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v0.312.0)

### 0.309.0 (Released 2017-08-04)
We addressed a bug we identified that resulted from "no power" alerts and auto-suspend events from Medtronic pumps.  

We also made some changes to address how the Uploader handles time changes during temporary basal rates.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/bnEjgwgW/13-uploaderbug-medtronic-direct-upload-with-erics-pump-fails-platform-validation)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v0.309.0)

### 0.307.0 (Released 2017-07-11)
Before we tell the world that Tidepool officially supports direct uploading of Medtronic 523, 530G, and 723 pumps using a Contour Next Link meter, we need to solidify our work and finish testing. How did we get here? I'm glad you asked.  

We need to make sure only supported pumps are uploaded through our direct uploading adventures. Sorry 522 and 722 folks.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/CdWv2kUz/23-prevent-un-support-medtronic-pumps-from-being-uploaded-through-medtronic-direct)

Seriously, we tried. The basal data coming off x22 pumps is not reliable enough for us.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/bu8ZX4WZ/22-0ux-3dev-2tst-medtronic-522)

We need to account for time change events accurately, because Daylight Saving is still a thing.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pGmiXf4s/16-ux0dev0tst3-uploader-test-medtronic-drivers-utc-bootstrapping)

We need to show CGM data from 530G pumps.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/vMtU8xkK/20-medtronic-cgm-data-uploader-dev-5-tst-2-ux-0)

We need to show accurate and detailed basal data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/zlAnS0iw/12-uploader-medtronic-basals)

We need to store and show device settings.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/qsKqeuFh/18-uploader-dev-3-tst-1-ux-0-medtronic-device-settings)

In case something goes wrong, we need to be able to save the raw binary data from the pump, affectionately called a "binary blob" for debugging and testing purposes.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1IFzNbHP/13-uploader-button-to-get-raw-binary-data-from-pump-in-debug-mode)

The Tidepool Uploader needs to show specific instructions to make sure our direct uploading works as intended.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/TiTc17UL/15-uploader-ui-enhancements-for-medtronic-direct-upload-dev-5-ux-1-tst-1)

We need to show blood glucose values stored on the pump.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/F4vTGbuQ/11-uploader-medtronic-smbg-values)

We need to make sure the data the Uploader and the back end are on the same page.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/HuNfebgZ/14-technical-investigation-for-medtronic-device-planning-ux0-dev2-tst0-platform-uploader)

We need to make sure you could view bolus wizard calculations.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/4Gn33urX/10-uploader-medtronic-calculator-data)

We need to accurately handle manual boluses.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/OAHqN8Ng/9-0ux-5dev-0tstuploader-medtronic-manual-boluses)

We need to handle device events gracefully.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/6b5oFTZl/8-uploader-medtronic-device-events)

Node needs an update.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/NWi3QK35/7-node-update-uploader)

Our Medtronic driver needs to be accurate for inquiring developers.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/qkp0Mfj6/21-uploader-medtronic-remaining-work-dev5-ux0-tst1)

The data we upload using our Medtronic driver has to match the data generated by the CareLink driver. We can't say we have a better option if the data tells a different story.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/T9jR2zH0/19-tool-to-compare-carelink-driver-output-with-medtronic-driver-output-uploader-ux0-dev5-tst2)

And all of that needs to be verified through an extensive Alpha test.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/oY4TZF73/17-l-medtronic-alpha-test-issue-resolution-card-uploader)

Pretty cool, right?

### 0.306.1 (Released 2017-06-10)
Chrome version 59.0.3071.86 started throwing "Invalid Time Value" errors during Dexcom uploads. The reason behind this is incredibly technical, but we figured it out and fixed that bug. Check out the Feature Requirements below for a detailed explanation of what's what.

Visit https://tidepool.org/mobile to learn more about Tidepool Mobile.  

### iOS - 2.1.12 (Released 2019-07-02)
We added a tooltip to prompt new Tidepool Mobile users to make a note after they've synced their data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://tidepool.atlassian.net/browse/MOBILE-9)

And addressed a design issue that prevented users from opening a note created as a result of that first time tooltip prompt.  
[Feature Requirements](https://tidepool.atlassian.net/browse/MOBILE-10)

[iOS Release](https://appsto.re/us/aXyl9.i)

### Android - 3.0.5 (Released 2019-06-13)
Technically this work also supports our eventual iOS update to a React Native code base so both Android and iOS versions of Tidepool Mobile will be using the same code base. This update continues to iterate upon the tooltips that display for fresh installs. We'll get to updating the current iOS release with these tooltips soon.

[Android Release](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.tidepool.urchin)

### Android - 3.0.3 (Released 2019-05-10)
We disabled some auto-update features for some of our code dependencies, which sounds complicated, but ultimately means we are ensuring we have full control over all the code that goes into Tidepool Mobile.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/sYiATRO0/7-disable-auto-update-of-js-bundles-for-android)

Meanwhile, we updated some other code dependencies to ensure our app stays available on Google Play.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/QBYgqqim/10-rn-remove-unused-branchio-support-to-avoid-google-play-rejection-update-to-latest-expo-32-update-other-dependencies)

We resolved a bug that, in some very specific scenarios, made some carb entries difficult to read.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pip9oZHn/8-rn-android-mobile-some-carb-circles-are-not-opaque-causing-carb-values-to-be-difficult-to-read)

[Android Release](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.tidepool.urchin)

### Android - 3.0.2 (Released 2019-04-04)
We addressed how you interact with notes in Tidepool Mobile. Specifically:  
Care team members should not be able to delete notes created by the person with diabetes.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/YZldb9Cd/4-rn-care-team-members-should-not-be-able-to-delete-notes-created-by-the-pwd)

Users should be able to delete notes that a care team member adds to their account.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/vi4RT6lC/3-rn-pwd-users-should-be-able-to-delete-a-note-that-a-care-team-member-adds-to-their-account)

And, care team members should only be able to delete notes they create.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/gFnvvn1z/2-rn-care-team-members-should-be-able-to-delete-notes-they-created)

[Android Release](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.tidepool.urchin)

### iOS - 2.1.11 (Released 2019-03-27)
We've updated how Tidepool Mobile translates HealthKit data to match our data model. It's nothing you'll notice unless you look under the hood, but our backend engineers are much happier now - which is always nice.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/93DcT6hS/22-ios-rn-tidepool-mobile-should-use-service-for-origintype-field-rather-than-manual)

We noticed a bug that prevented workouts data from uploading properly, and buttoned that one up so future uploads would not cause an error.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/u5hPQeer/23-ios-crashes-during-sync-to-health-from-a-new-workout-type)

[iOS Release](https://appsto.re/us/aXyl9.i)

### Android 3.0.1 (Released 2019-03-26)
We've updated the SDK that supports Tidepool Mobile to Expo 31. Yay!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/2r3yD8Rf/18-rn-expo-31)

As our Android and iOS versions of Tidepool Mobile take on similar version numbers, we need to easily identify which platform is being used in our reporting tools. We're good now.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Pqfmwqtv/19-rn-differentiate-android-and-ios-in-kissmetrics)

Our initial Android release asked for a lot of permissions that were unnecessary. We've reduced those requests significantly to ensure we stay in our lane.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/52mBPh19/20-rn-reduce-android-permissions-requests)

Android phones trying to view data from DIY Loop were not happy, and often crashed. Not wanting to leave anyone out of the fun, we've fixed this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/j9lzOsIJ/21-rn-note-visualization-fails-in-301-37300)

[Android Release](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.tidepool.urchin)

### iOS - 2.1.10 (Released 2019-02-16)
Now that Tidepool Mobile can support biological sex, we've finished the work to allow this data from Apple Health to update your profile if it wasn't previously set.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/76bqo44s/35-add-biologicalsex-from-healthkit-to-tidepool)

CGM data from International versions of Dexcom Mobile were not being registered as CGM data...which was odd. And now that's fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/l5aiZR6Y/36-ios-cbg-whitelisting-changed-so-it-will-catch-any-sourcename-that-includes-dexcom)

We fixed some spacing issues that occurred when a carb entry was masking a low blood glucose data point.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1nYsQ3lq/37-ios-219-fix-padding-spacing-so-that-carbs-dont-cover-low-bgs)

Blood glucose data will now display in mmol/L if you've set that as your display unit preference. If you were a fan of dividing by 18.01559 in your head, that's cool. We hope this will make things easier for everyone else.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/MZ2iLbeW/38-ios-add-mmol-l-support)

If you changed your default blood glucose targets in Tidepool Web, you should expect to see those same targets in Tidepool Mobile. We noticed a bug that indicated this wasn't the case. Now that's actually happened.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/WjbeaNWn/39-ios-217-vis-bg-thresholds-not-adhering-to-user-customized-settings)

The combination of smaller screens and longer notes caused some jittering when notes were being typed out. We've fixed this bug.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/heSUQMwJ/40-ios-219-adding-comments-to-notes-on-tm217-results-in-jitter-effect-on-smaller-screens-longer-comments)

Keeping current, Tidepool Mobile now runs on Swift 4.2.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Zl4i0oES/42-ios-219-update-for-swift-42)

Investigating recent crash reports from the App Store has led us to a few small fixes that should improve things for our users. Thanks for sending those reports in everyone!

[iOS Release](https://appsto.re/us/aXyl9.i)

### iOS - 2.1.9 (Released 2019-01-16)
Tidepool Mobile on iOS now supports insulin, carbohydrate, blood glucose, workouts, and biological sex data from Apple Health. We're really proud of this one.  
Feature Requirements...deep breath!
